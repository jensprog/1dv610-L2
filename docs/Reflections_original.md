# Reflections Original

## Documentation
I have written my reflections on my own, have not used any tools to make the text using better grammar etc.

## LLM
I only used ChatGPT to help me create tables in MD-format, the content inside the tables was written by myself.
I used ChatGPT to create a table with my unit tests, the unit tests with JUnit were written by myself and I wanted to be efficient and not write the tests again in a table format.
