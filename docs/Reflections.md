## Naming (Classes/methods/variables)

| Name                       | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Reflection and rules Clean Code |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| UnitConversionQueryParser  | Class name (src/main/java/jensprog/parser)  |    **Class name**: The class name fulfills the book’s "rule" of a noun phrase or a noun. It describes what it parses and what the class is. **Use Pronounceable names**: You can say it easily, but it’s quite long so maybe you could remove the "Query" part of the class name.                              |
| UnitConversionQueryFormatter | Class name (src/main/java/jensprog/formatter)                              |   **Avoid Mental Mapping**: I believe that I could use more clarity in the naming of this class. The purpose of the class is to format and display the conversion between two units. A change to "UnitConversionDisplayFormatter" might be better.                                     |
| convert(double value)      | Method name (src/main/java/jensprog/unitconverter/LengthConverter.java)                         |     **Method names**: The naming is short, but it says what it does. I could be more explicit and create methods for each conversion e.g., "convertMeterToCentimeter" but when using the convert method I believe it shows its action.                                |
| getValue()                 |    Method name (src/main/java/jensprog/parser/UnitConversionQueryParser.java)                                                                                                      |           **Pick One Word per Concept**: The usage of "get" is used across the module. I don’t use "fetch", "retrieve", etc. for different "getter" methods, they use only one word.                           |
| fromUnit                   | Instance variable/parameter (src/main/java/jensprog/unitconverter/LengthConverter.java)                                                        |     **Use Intention-Revealing Names**: The instance variable/parameter could be better in my opinion if I changed it to "fromSourceUnit". I decided to stick to this naming instead because I think it’s clear enough.   |

## Reflection Chapter 2

I have not reflected as much of naming before as I do now when reading the book and also focus on it. It is harder than I expected and so far from my experience, the more a class/method/variable do, the harder it is to give them good descriptive names. I have started creating certain methods (example below) with names I did not like, I understood what the method did but if someone looked at the name of the method, they might not get it immediately. When I created classes or methods with names I thought were good, I felt that someone from the outside don't have to check what the class actually does or what the behaviour of the method is, since the naming was good.

Before reading the book I have not thought about nouns and verbs, why it's better that classes have nouns and methods have verbs. 

A good example of bad naming (which is now removed) is this method that is suppose to check the array of strings for the "to" word. I had no clue how to name the method well, so to maybe understand what it does you had to check inside the method. ![Bad naming example](images/checkToKeyword.png)
