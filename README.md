# Unit Converter String Parser Module

## Installation

Users need **Java version 17+ for Gradle 9.0.0**. When you clone the repo and the first time you run a ./gradlew command you will get the Gradle version 9.0.0 since the wrapper files are in the repository.

```bash
# Example of a gradle command
  ./gradlew test
```

## Usage

The **String Parser** is used to convert different units in a more natural langugage using user input.

```bash
# Example of a user input and output
Enter length to convert (e.g., '15.5 meter to kilometer'): 10 meter to kilometer
10.0 meters is 0.01 kilometers
```
